# House-Price-Prediction

In this project, I meticulously conducted comprehensive data preprocessing utilizing powerful libraries such as Pandas and NumPy. Furthermore, I employed data visualization techniques using Seaborn and Matplotlib to gain valuable insights and ensure data quality. Subsequently, I delved into feature selection methodologies, which encompassed leveraging correlation analysis, SelectKBest, and ExtraTreeRegressor, enabling the identification of the most influential variables.

The project then progressed to encompass the development of predictive models. I expertly crafted a range of models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, harnessing the diverse strengths of each algorithm to maximize prediction accuracy. In addition, I fine-tuned the model performance by employing advanced techniques such as hyperparameter tuning through RandomizedSearchCV.

The culmination of this project involved a meticulous comparative analysis of the various models, evaluating their respective strengths and weaknesses. This thorough assessment ultimately facilitated the selection of the most appropriate model for the task at hand. Consequently, I successfully applied the chosen model to make predictions on a test dataset, providing actionable insights and solutions based on the project's objectives.
